Foxified Citadel

    "My analysis of historical data suggests an 97.34% probability that you are aware of my birth on your planet, and my rebirth into beauty on Citadel Station. A Foxified Citadel..." -System Shock 2 (totally, totally...)  

This mod is a forward port of the [Citadel library mod by AlexModGuy et al.](https://modrinth.com/mod/citadel), it thus far contains little to no original code that bears any functional changes to the original, and only intends to change the original for the sake of bug fixes or performance, with no intent to add new features or modify existing features in their purposes.  
Here is the original mod's description as per the Modrinth page:  
Citadel is a Library mod required for advanced animations and entity properties in 1.14 and beyond. Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.  
  
In versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.  

    End of original mod description.  

Please report issues you encounter with this library to its own repository, as any bugs may be caused due to a skill issue on my part in regard to porting. AlexModGuy has shown as far as I know no intent in making 1.21 bug fixes or forwardporting Citadel, so don't bother him with this port's issues.
